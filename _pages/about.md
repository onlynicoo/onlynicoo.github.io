Hey! I’m Nicola, currently a master’s student at the University of Padua (UNIPD), where I’m also working on my master’s thesis at ETH Zürich, co-supervised by [Prof. Giorgio Satta](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MLTHFaAAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Ryan Cotterell](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DexOqtoAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra).

My research interests lie in the intersection of artificial intelligence and formal language theory, with a focus on understanding the theoretical guarantees of AI models. Currently, I’m exploring the expressiveness of transformer models through the lens of formal language theory, aiming to uncover what these models can actually do.

Before diving into this field, I completed my bachelor's and master's at UNIPD. During my master's, I was awarded a [12k€ grant](https://www.unipd.it/sites/unipd.it/files/2023/Prot_Verbale%20riunione%20da%20remotoComm%20BPISS_30_10_2023.pdf.pdf) to develop a project in computer vision, and I’ve maintained a mean score of 29.7/30 throughout my studies.

Outside of academics, I’m deeply passionate about reggae music (but not only). My friends and I even built our own soundsystem! When I'm not immersed in theory or working on a project, you'll likely find me listening to music while searching for new oportunities.
