Hi! I’m Nicola, a master’s student at the University of Padua (UniPD), currently completing an exchange semester at ETH Zürich to work on my thesis, co-supervised by [Prof. Giorgio Satta](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MLTHFaAAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Ryan Cotterell](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DexOqtoAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra).

My thesis lie in the intersection of artificial intelligence and formal language theory, with a focus on understanding the theoretical guarantees of AI models. Currently, I’m exploring the expressiveness of transformer models through the tools of formal language theory, aiming to uncover what these models can actually do.

Before diving into this field, I completed my bachelor's and master's degree at UniPD. During my master's, I was awarded a [12k€ grant](https://www.unipd.it/sites/unipd.it/files/2023/Prot_Verbale%20riunione%20da%20remotoComm%20BPISS_30_10_2023.pdf.pdf) to develop a project in computer vision. I’ve consistently maintained a high academic standing, with a GPA of 29.7/30 throughout my studies.

Outside of academics, I’m deeply passionate about reggae music (but not only), my friends and I built our own soundsystem! When I’m not immersed in research or new projects, you can find me exploring new music and seeking out fresh opportunities.
