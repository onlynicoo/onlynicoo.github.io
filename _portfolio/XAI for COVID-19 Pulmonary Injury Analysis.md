### Academic Project: XAI for COVID-19 Pulmonary Injury Analysis

Developed a deep learning project to analyze medical data related to COVID-19 pulmonary injuries, focusing on explainability and visualization of model decisions.

#### The project includes:
- **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** for feature importance analysis
- **Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping)** to highlight regions of interest in medical images
- **Application of XAI** to enhance interpretability of deep learning models in medical diagnosis
