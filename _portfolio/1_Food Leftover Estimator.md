### Academic Project: Food Leftover Estimation Using Computer Vision

Developed a C++ project with OpenCV to estimate food leftovers by detecting and segmenting food on trays before and after meals.

#### The project includes:
- **Traditional computer vision techniques** such as hadcrafted features for food detection and segmentation
- **Pre- and post-meal analysis** to compute overall food waste
- **Useful metrics generation** for food waste estimation and analysis
